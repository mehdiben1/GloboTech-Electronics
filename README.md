# GloboTech-Electronics : 2016 - 2022

# Project Background:
**GloboTech Electronics** is a global electronics retailer **operating since 2016**, with a diversified sales strategy that includes both e-commerce and brick-and-mortar stores across multiple regions. The company offers a wide range of consumer electronics from top brands, catering to customers in North America, Europe, Asia, and beyond.

Over the years, GloboTech has accumulated a substantial volume of operational and transactional data, covering everything from sales transactions and product catalogs to customer demographics, store locations, and currency exchange rates. However, this data remains largely unstructured and under-leveraged across departments.

As a data analyst, my role is to transform this raw data into actionable insights that can support data-driven decision-making for key stakeholders, particularly the executive leadership and strategy teams.
